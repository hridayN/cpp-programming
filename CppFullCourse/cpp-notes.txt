The source code written by programmers is stored in the file program.c. 
This program.c file is then processed by preprocessors and an expanded source code file is generated named program. (preprocessors -> expanded source code file)
This expanded file, program is compiled by the compiler and an object code file is generated named program.obj. (compiler -> object code file)
Finally, the linker links this object code file, program.obj to the object code of the library functions to generate the executable file program.exe. (linker -> executable file)
